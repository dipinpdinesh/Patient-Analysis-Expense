# Patient-Analysis-Expenses
Got a dataset from 'multiple data resources" today showing the personal expense of a patient, analyzing which the person or insurance companies can get an idea about how much sum the patient must be insured !! 


Analysis Output Obtained is : Smoking People spend much amount for treatments hence need more insurance coverage
